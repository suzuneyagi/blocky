    Random block generation implemented: Inside Piece.java we implemented getNextPiece() which returns the piece in array PieceKind[] ALL or shuffles the array and returns its first element if we run out of shuffled elements. For Piece Object, we changed the kind field to this.kind = getNextPiece(); so that each new piece generated receives the random shape.

    Shuffle implemented: Inside PieceKind.java we implemented the shuffle() method that takes an array of PieceKind elements (forms) ieceKind[] ALL and shuffles them using Fisher-Yates Shuffle.

    This is the sixth error: We inverted the vertical axis of our rendering function paintComponent() to fix the directions the blocks fall (down instead of up). For two calls fillRect() we passed an inverted height/row parameter (second argument).

    This is the fifth error: Fixed the deletion of completed rows by passing the "row" (not the boolean value "well[row]") to the completeRows.add(row) call inside getCompletedRows() method inside Board.java

    This is the fourth error: We changed <= to < inside isValidPosition and now the program doesn't throw out of bound error and we can move left and right
    Initially in Board.java: When moving right the program was throwing "Index 10 out of bounds for length 10." We made the bounds strict (< instad of <= and > instad of >=) inside the isValidPosition() method. This allowed the piece to move back from right.

    This is the third error: we added processMovement() in the step() method to be able to move the block left and right
    Initially in BlockyGame.java: We saw that processMovement() was highlighting yellow, meaning it wasn't used anywhere.
    To allow the piece to move left and right, we added the processMovement() call to step().

    This is the second error: case RIGHT inside processMovement() method in BlockyGame.java was missing a break
    Initially in BlockyGame.java the case for movement RIGHT was missing a break. we added a break statement.

commit 17b98c7bae839c5adec148bd29271d173d8418ab

Date:   Sat Sep 20 21:11:36 2025 -0500

    This is the first error with readRotation column forloop out of bounds
    Initially in Loader.java: iterated through 5 columns while the rotation array only held 4 values. We change column bound to 4 so that the loop iterates only through 4 values.
